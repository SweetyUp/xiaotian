	<p>👋 Welcome to my personal academic webpage! My name is Qí Xiàotián, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication at the Communication University of China. My research focus during my master's program is in the field of Intelligent Media Technology and Applications, which is an emerging interdisciplinary field primarily exploring the practical applications of AI technology in the realm of media.</p>
<p>On this webpage, you will find information about my educational background, project experiences, internships, and any awards or accolades I have received. If you are interested in connecting with me, please feel free to reach out via email at xiaotianqi@cuc.edu.cn.</p>
<p><strong>research interests</strong>：
After the advent of ChatGPT, my interest in the potential societal implications of artificial intelligence in role-playing social interactions has grown significantly. Inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442"><em>Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior</em></a>, I have actively embarked on building a NPC interaction system similar to what is described in the paper. Through a series of experiments, I have become greatly enthused about the potential of artificial intelligence in simulating social phenomena and communication dynamics. I aspire to conduct in-depth research into human social phenomena and communication theories through technological means, exploring entirely new narrative modes empowered by AI.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Abilities</strong>: I possess a strong technical foundation, capable of independently undertaking tasks such as AI model training and deployment, building front-end and back-end systems, and conducting data crawling and analysis. Simultaneously, I have actively engaged in research projects within the field of communication studies, establishing a foundation in humanities and social sciences. These interdisciplinary experiences instill confidence in me that I can effectively address various challenges in future research endeavors and make unique contributions to the academic domain.</p>

<h2>Project Experience</h2>
<h3>AI Who's the Impostor (Collaboration and Competition of Intelligent NPCs in Multi-Agent Systems)</h3>
<div align="right">2023.6 - 2023.8</div>

<ul>
<li>Project Overview: This project aims to address challenges in the field of multi-agent systems, specifically focusing on improving the performance of intelligent NPCs in terms of cooperation and competition strategies, which currently fall short of human capabilities. Using large language models and reinforcement learning techniques, the project endeavors to enable NPCs in a multi-agent system to exhibit human-like intelligence in the "AI Who's the Impostor" game. This involves building a game prototype system, creating datasets, training custom models, and designing unique reward models and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) strategies to optimize the current model's performance, thereby investigating the alignment of language models with specific tasks. Currently, the custom model has achieved results on par with chatGPT in this task.</li>
</ul>
<h2>- Key Responsibilities: Building a game prototype system using chatGPT, constructing datasets, training custom models for the game, designing exclusive reward models and RLHF strategies, and researching how to leverage reinforcement learning to improve the current model's performance.</h2>
